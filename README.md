# SCM-RAC-Concrete-Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for a multi-output machine learning framework designed to predict multiple mechanical and durability properties of concrete mixtures, including compressive strength (CS), tensile strength (TS), flexural strength (FS), elastic modulus (E), slump (SL), drying shrinkage (DS), and chloride permeability (CP). The framework combines domain-informed feature engineering, Bayesian hyperparameter optimization, and selective information transfer to improve predictions for sparsely reported properties while maintaining interpretability and robustness.
