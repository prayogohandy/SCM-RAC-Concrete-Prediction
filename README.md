# SCM-RAC-Concrete-Prediction
This repository contains the code  for a multi-output machine learning framework designed to predict multiple mechanical and durability properties of concrete mixtures, including compressive strength (CS), tensile strength (TS), flexural strength (FS), elastic modulus (E), slump (SL), drying shrinkage (DS), and chloride permeability (CP).
